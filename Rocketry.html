    <h3>Triplet Impinging Rocket Injector for Seraphim Engine</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">I was one of the main members involved with the development of the LRE team's rocket injector, which was designed manufactured and tested. I am the current injector lead and am working to iterate on the design so it is fully ready for flight. Much more detail is available below. </p>

    <h3>Seraphim engine Hot-Fire</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">I took charge of preparing, updating, and operating the horizontal test stand so it was fully pressurized and ready for engine hot fire. I am currently the team's main test stand operator and am trying to document and impart my knowledge to the club's future stand operators.  </p>

    <h3>Seraphim engine Ablative Version</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">Working on the design and analysis of the ablative version of the Seraphim engine. Utilizing CFD to fully characterize nozzle outflow and developping an ablation model using the combustion species to determine the total recession rate of the graphite nozzle throat to characterize the chages in A* throughtout the engine burn time. The main purpose of this project is to finalize the engine design that will be manufactured and tested in the Spring 2026 semester.  </p>

    <h3>Horizontal Stand Engine Mounting</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">Did all the structural calculations for the new mounting plate of the horizontal stand's load cell carriage, analyzing the factor of safety against buckling and yielding using FEA simulations and hand caculations. Designed and implemented the new plate with a secondary support structure to minize the moment on the standoff's holding the engine. </p>

    <h3>Engine Heat Transfer Python Code</h3></h3>
    <p class="margin-project">Updated a legacy Python script developed by a former team member to enable plotting of additional nodes along the engine profile and incorporated new equations to fully parameterize the geometry. This allowed iterative optimization of the converging section for improved heat transfer and reduced engine weight while maintaining thermal integrity.  </p>

    <h3>Team Lead of Liquid Rocket Engine Team of the Aerospace NU Club</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">As the team lead I oversee around 20-30 students, organize and teach machining learning sessions, and work with external suppliers and sponsors. I help manage and advance the team's projects in the hopes of acheiving a 2027 vehicle launch for the foot per dollar challenge.</p>

    <h3>Northeastern Aerospace Club (Redshift Propulsion Team 2023)</h3>
    <p class="margin-project">As part of the Redshift Propulsion team we worked on a regenerative Kero-LOX engine to be used in a rocket for the foot per dollar challenge. On this team I was involved in the development of the swirl injector, LOX/kerosene quick disconnect system and the glow plug integration for an ASI igniter system.</p>
